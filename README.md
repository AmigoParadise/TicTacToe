# TicTacToe
Create a browser-based Tic Tac Toe game in JavaScript. Focus on object-oriented programming using factory functions and the module pattern to keep code clean and modular. You'll build the core game logic for the console first, then integrate DOM manipulation for a complete, interactive web application.
